what does what i think

SaveRAM[4001]: if we are using cutscene act transition/act fade
CutsceneActivate: if were doing a cutscene 1, else 0

CutsceneActFinish: controls act transitions and starts up cutscenes
CutsceneControl:   controls player            during the cutscene      woah
CutsceneSignPost: uhh idk??     blocks off the signpost area so you cant go back
NoFadeInTitleCard:    activates with saveram 4001
